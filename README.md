# News-Scraper

We were to create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

This application allows user to scrape news articles from http://www.nytimes.com, save articles on a seperate page, and add/delete comments on specific articles. Each article contains a headline, summary, and a url link to the original. This application utilizes Node.js/Express for the server, MongoDB/Mongoose for the database, Cheerio/Axios for scraping, and Handlebars for the layout.
